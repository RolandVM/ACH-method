#Dynamic-Time-Warping #Time-Series #Pattern-Matching

Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) quantifies the similarity between two temporal sequences through the computation of their overall Euclidean distance, a process which remains effective even with constrained datasets. Unlike methodologies that presuppose a specific form of data trajectory, DTW conducts comparisons of time series patterns objectively, thus facilitating an evaluation of alterations in psychological indicators such as depressive and isolationist tendencies. By dynamically adjusting to match patterns in data sequences, it offers a viable tool for aligning temporal datasets through a process of sequence elongation or contraction.
