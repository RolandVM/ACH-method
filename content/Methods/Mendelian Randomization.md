#Mendelian-Randomization #Causal-Inference #Genetics

Conduct an analysis to establish a causal relationship between two phenotypic traits using genetic data, based on the principle that Mendelian segregation creates a quasi-randomized trial. This involves employing genetic variants as instrumental variables to explore the causal impact of a particular trait or exposure on disease outcomes.
