Progressing the development of non-invasive diagnostic and prognostic test methods within healthcare through the use of artificial intelligence, with a particular emphasis on conditions such as liver fibrosis, steatosis, and Hepatitis B. This involves the invention of an innovative feature selection methodology and employment of linguistic models to detect potential bias within datasets. Usage of machine learning algorithms enhances the precision and performance efficiency of these diagnostic tests.
