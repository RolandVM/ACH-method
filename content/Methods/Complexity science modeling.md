This approach involves the analysis of dynamical systems with the aim of detecting emergent patterns including, but not limited to, behavioral trends within groups or patterns of depressive symptom trajectories. It provides a comprehensive survey of diverse methodologies tailored for the investigation of these patterns subject to specific research inquiries and data. Furthermore, it employs the tenets of complexity science to develop models for intricate systems and their dynamical properties.
