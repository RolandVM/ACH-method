#Genome-wide-Association #Genetic-Variants #Disease-Risk

Conducts genomic analysis to discern genetic variants associated with a targeted trait of interest. Different phenotypic categories can be analysed, such as continuous attributes, case-control comparisons, and case-case studies. This process entails systematized identification of genetic variants across the genome associated with distinct traits or diseases.
